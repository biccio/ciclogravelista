## What is Ciclogravelista
In 2019 I lost my wife to cancer. In the same year i turned 50, and I had just discovered the pleasure to ride a bicycle. That pleasure became my way to process grief. I began travelling with my bicycle and I decided to start a blog where I can share my travels and give full shape to my thoughts. 

## Why Github
I started this blog on Wordpress in 2019, then I decided to move it on Github, using Hugo as framework and Netlify as deployment tool to make it more lightweight and fast.

## Is it in english?
No, the blog is only in Italian at this time, but I will provide an english version as soon as I'll be able to.

Made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
